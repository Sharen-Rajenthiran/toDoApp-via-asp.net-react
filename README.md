## Details + Demo Gif
Since this was a technical assessment and not a personal project, in-depth details is not provided in this README. This is intended for the Hiring Managers only. 

Various resources were used to complete this assessment, such as referring to documentation, open sources, and coding assistants. The code is written by me, and for the parts I needed clarification, I referred to the sources mentioned. This helped me to stay grounded and ensure proper code is written. This was also a learning process for me because C# and ASP.NET Core a still new concept to me but I find it interesting and hope to continue working on it. After a week of working on this assessment, here is the final product (only the UI is shown here and please wait a few seconds for the gif to play):
